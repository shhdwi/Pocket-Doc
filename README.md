<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>Pocket Doc helps users to track their daily health status by giving them an option to enter their daily health status in form of text along with a medicine tracker to track users' ongoing medications. This way, users can record their daily health status and medications and track their progress.</p>
<h2>Challenges and Problems Faced</h2>
<p>Integrating Firebase with Flutter and performing CRUD operations and queries was a quite cumbersome task. Pushing notifications to the user and performing tasks on the background threads was also challenging. The most challenging part was to formulate the idea and implement it using a Flutter application.</p>
<h2>Future Plans</h2>
<p>Pocket Doc can contain lots of other features. We plan to integrate online doctor consultation with Pocket Doc. A doctor can provide feedback to the user and fix further appointments with him/her. A doctor can also provide a questionnare to the user which user can fill in order to keep track of his daily health status. Moreover, the medicine tracker can be automated so that the doctor's medications are automatically added to it.</p>
